		// variables can be either declared (no value assigned) or initialized (value assigned)

			// object name generally start with lower case, follow camel case or snake case feature
			// = equal operator, new is a keyword of Java
			
			// What happened below? Try to Understand, if don't, no problem
			// an object is created (tofael) (by you) from 'MyInfo' class (following blueprint) which (object) is new and MyInfo type
			// This action (line 73) --> (when an object is created from a class) is called "instantiation", (vvImp info)
			// Then we say the class (MyInfo) is instantiated or Class Instantiated
			
			// This is not mandatory to write the object name ---> same as class name
			// Also, we can create more than one object from a class
			
			// When an object [tofael] is created from a class [MyInfo], Constructor is initialized
			// what object do? Ans: object can call the properties [variables, constructor, method] of the class [from where it is created]
			MyInfo tofael = new MyInfo();

			System.out.println(tofael.myYearlySalary);
